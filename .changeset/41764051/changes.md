- `startAuthedSession` now takes an `audiences` paramter, which is attached to the session. `createSessionMiddleware` takes an `audiences` parameter, which is passed through to `startAudthedSession` at `signin`. Added `restrictAudienceMiddleware`, which allows access to an endpoint to be restricted based on which audiences are currently attached to the session.
